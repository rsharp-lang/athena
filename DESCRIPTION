Description: Framework for an AI-Driven Data Analytics System Powered by Large Language Models.

   This framework provides a foundational toolkit to accelerate the development of AI-powered 
   data analytics applications, primarily targeting the rapid implementation of natural language-based 
   interactive analytics systems. The architecture enables developers to efficiently construct 
   intelligent data processing solutions through modular components optimized for natural 
   language understanding and analytical reasoning.

   Key features
   1. Core LLM integration layer for semantic interpretation
   2. Prebuilt analytical operator library
   3. Conversational interface abstraction module
   4. Automated query-to-code translation engine

   The system particularly excels in scenarios requiring natural language interaction with structured 
   datasets, significantly reducing development cycles for intelligent analytics platforms while 
   maintaining enterprise-grade scalability and security standards.
